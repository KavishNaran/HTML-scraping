# HTML-scraping

# Background

You’re now ready to take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organising and storing data, analysing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

The information which was scraped contained the following information:

Titles and preview text from the website.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyse Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

The Data Set which was scraped contained the following information:

- id: the identification number of a single transmission from the Curiosity rover
- terrestrial_date: the date on Earth
- sol: the number of elapsed sols (Martian days) since Curiosity landed on Mars
- ls: the solar longitude
- month: the Martian month
- min_temp: the minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single Martian day (sol)
- pressure: The atmospheric pressure at Curiosity's location
